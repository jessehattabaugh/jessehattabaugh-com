		<p>I grew up in rural Arkansas. We got the Internet when I was in High School and I taught myself to make
			websites. I moved to San Francisco California in 2006, and then to Portland Oregon in 2018.</p>

		<h4>What I've done</h4>

		<p>I've rebuilt and repaired a few old cars and motorcycles, including a 1961 Chevy Corvair, a 1969 Honda
			Superhawk, and a 1995 Toyota Previa. I'm currently tinkering with a 1970 Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback.</p>

		<p>I like fixing and riding old bicycles. I have about a dozen in various states of functionality. Including a
			beach cruiser that I converted to electric using a Bafang BBS02 kit, and 52v battery. I like
			bike-touring/bike-camping. In 2009 I rode a Surly Long Haul Trucker from San Francisco, to Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>I do some gardening. I raised a mess of pumpkins last summer, and I'm going to try my hand at potatoes this
			year. I've also grown mushrooms.</p>

			<li>Don't make assumptions.</li>
			<li>Always do your best.</li>
