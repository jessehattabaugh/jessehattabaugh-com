		<h2>ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŽ Welcome to my site!</h2>

		<p>I'm a web developer from Portland Oregon. I like to ride bicycles and play video games. </p>

		<h3>About this site</h3>

		<p>This site is a PWA so you can install it to share things with me.</p>

		<p>This site is a <a href="https://fwa.dev">functional web app</a> hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> using <a href="https://enhance.dev/">Enhance</a> and <a href="https://arc.codes/">Architect</a>. The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessehattabaugh/jessehattabaugh-com">GitHub</a>.</p>

		<p>The erudite among you will have noticed the presence of a certain classic font. Rest assured this is a @font-face, so it will appear the same on any device; even those not fortunate enough to have it installed locally! You're welcome!</p>
