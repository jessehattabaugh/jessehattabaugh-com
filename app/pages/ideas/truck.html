	<h2>My Truck</h2>

	<p>In the summer of 2022 I bought a Datsun 320 pickup truck from a guy in Seattle. It's a tiny little Japanese Kei
		truck, and one of the first vehicles ever sold by Nissan in the United States. Since then it's been sitting on
		the street beside my house, waiting for me to get around to fixing it up. It doesn't have an engine, so I've
		been considering several possibilities for getting it moving:</p>

	<p>The most obvious choice would be to take the engine and transmission from a late model rear engine car or truck.
		The trouble is that the original engine was a very small 1.2 liter four cylinder, but modern engines are all 2
		liters or more. Finding something that can fit in the engine compartment without cutting the firewall or grille
		would be a challenge.</p>

	<p>The next choice would be an electric motor and battery. There aren't any kits for this truck specifically, but
		many people have used old Tesla motors and batteries to electrify old cars. The trouble is that they're very
		expensive, and I'm not sure I want to spend that much money on a truck that's only worth a few hundred dollars.
	</p>

	<p>My most exotic idea is to build a Series Hydraulic Hybrid system; something I first heard about in the mid '00s,
		when the EPA was researching alternative power trains. The idea is actually pretty simple; a hydraulic
		pump/motor is connected to the driveshaft instead of a regular engine and transmission. Pressurized fluid comes
		from an accumulator tank. A small engine that powers a second pump is used to build pressure initially. Then
		when it's time to slow the truck down the direction of flow can be reversed and fluid will be pumped back into
		the accumulator by the pump/motor. In addition to this regenerative braking, the system is more efficient
		because the engine can run at it's ideal RPM constantly until the accumulator is full at which point it can shut
		off.</p>

	<p>This last idea is the most interesting to me, and I think I can handle the fabrication that it will require to
		make it work, and the parts required can all be sourced from industrial supply shopes like Grainger. I just need
		to pick the parts with the right specs to make it work well so I don't waste money on parts that don't work well
		together.</p>

	<h3>The Truck</h3>

	<p>Here are the relevant specs of the truck:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Rear Differential Ratio:</dt>
		<dd>4.875:1</dd>
		<dt>Wheel (and tire) Diameter:</dt>
		<dd>25"</dd>
		<dt>Weight:</dt>
		<dd>2000lbs</dd>
	</dl>


	<h3>Required Parts</h3>

	<p>Here's a list of the parts I think I'll need to make this work:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Hydraulic Pump/Motor</li>
		<li>Chain drive</li>
		<li>Clutch</li>
		<li>Fluid Reservoir</li>
		<li>Accumulator Tank</li>
		<li>Engine</li>
		<li>Engine Pump</li>
		<li>Throttle Valve</li>
		<li>Directional Valve</li>
		<li>Fluid Cooler</li>
		<li>Fluid Filter</li>
		<li>Fluid</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Pump Motor</h3>

	<p>The heart of the system is the pump/motor, and it's specs will impact almost everything else. The rate of flow
		will determine how quickly the pressure in the accumulator will be depleted. It's maximum RPM will limit the
		ultimate speed of the truck. It's displacement, pressure limit, and gearing will determine how much torque it
		can produce.</p>

	<p>I think the <a href="https://www.grainger.com/product/PARKER-Hydraulic-Motor-TF-30E837">Parker TF-30E837</a> has
		the right specs for the job. It's rated for 3000psi of pressure, which is more than most accumulators can take.
		It displaces only 4.9 cu in/rev, while still making 1948 in-lbs of torque. It's maximum RPM is 693. So it's
		maximum flow rate at max-RPM is 14.7 GPM</p>

	<h3>Crossmember</h3>

	<p>Since there is no transmission, I will need to fabricate a crossmember to support the driveshaft. Since the
		pump-motor will be spinning at a different speed than the driveshaft, I will need a chain drive to connect them,
		and a clutch to disengage the pump-motor when I want to coast. The crossmember will need to be strong enough to
		support the weight of the driveshaft, and the torque of the pump-motor. It will also need to be adjustable so
		that I can tension the chain drive.</p>

	<h3>Chain Drive</h3>

	<p>The chain can be some kind of roller chain like motorcycle chain since it will have similar loads and RPM.
		Sprocket and cogs will need to be matched to the pump/motor and clutch splines.</p>

	<h3>Clutch</h3>

	<p>Since each revolution of the motor will consume fluid from the accumulator, I will want a clutch so that I can
		coast without using fluid. This will give the system time to replenish pressure. As a side benefit clutches can
		sometimes slip to prevent overtorquing. This could protect the chain for example. </p>

	<h3>Accumulator</h3>

	<p>The accumulator is likely to be the most expensive part of this build. They come in many sizes, and several
		styles. The larger the capacity the longer the truck will be able to accelerate without the pressure dropping.
		The higher the maximum pressure the more torque the motor will be able to generate. The size of the inlets and
		outlets will determine how efficiently fluid can flow through the system.</p>

	<p>I think the <a href="https://www.grainger.com/product/PARKER-Bladder-Accumulator-2-4VV77">Parker
			BA10B3T01P2GRG</a> will do. It's rated for 3000psi of pressure, which is more than most pumps can take. It
		has a maximum flow rate of 220 gallons per minute which is MUCH more than the pump-motor needs at full RPM. It's
		20" tall, and 12" in diameter, so it should fit in the bed of the truck. It's 1" NPT, which is
		a common size for hydraulic fittings. The most important quality in an accumulator will be it's
	</p>

	<h3>Engine/Pump</h3>

	<p>The engine that builds pressure can be quite small since the accumulator will store the energy like a wound up
		spring. The larger it is the faster it can replenish the pressure in the accumulator. Once the accumulator is at
		maximum pressure it can automatically shut off. This makes a generator, or air-compressor motor ideal since
		these are often equiped with automatic start/stop switches. Diesel motors are efficient, and it'd be nice to use
		bio-diesel for some extra green points.</p>

	<h3>Throttle Valve</h3>

	<p>When there is pressure in the accumulator, and the clutch is engaged, the throttle valve will control the flow of
		fluid to the pump/motor. This will allow me to control the acceleration of the truck.</p>

	<h3>Directional Valve</h3>

	<p>The directional valve will switch the direction of fluid flow from the motor to/from the accumulator. This will
		allow for regenerative braking when the truck is in motion, and also for allowing the truck to backup. Perhaps
		counter intuitively, when the flow is reversed, the throttle will control the flow of fluid back into the
		accumulator modulating the braking resistence. The pressure of the accumulator will also cause the regenrative
		braking to be more or less effective. As such, a normal friction brake will also need to be in place as a
		backup. </p>
