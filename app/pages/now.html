		<h3>What I'm doing right now</h3>

		<h3>What I care about</h3>

		<p>I care about my neighborhood. Northeast Portland is a great place to live and I want to make it even better.
		</p>

		<p>I care about waste. I try to find ways to reuse things that would otherwise be thrown away.</p>

		<p>I care for my garden. I've grown pumpkins, and mushrooms. I'm thinking of growing potatoes this year.</p>

		<h3>What I could use help with</h3>

		<p>I need some clean dirt for my garden. If you have some to spare, let me know.</p>

		<p>My project car is a 1970 Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback. The fuel injection system isn't functional because the
			ECM isn't sending a signal to the fuel pump relay when the ignition key is on. I may need a new ECM, or
			maybe the ECM I have can be repaired. </p>
