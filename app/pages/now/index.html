		<h3>What I'm doing right now</h3>

		<p>Building an ActivityPub implementation that can be deployed to AWS, <a href="https://dfinity.org/">Internet
				Computer Protcol</a>, <a href="https://fleek.network/">Fleek Network</a>, or some other serverless
			application platform.</li>

		<p>I am getting into <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/p/?code=PR1P2KAM">geocaching</a>.</p>

		<h3>What I care about</h3>

		<p>I care about my neighborhood. Northeast Portland is a great place to live and I want to make it even better.
		</p>

		<p>I care about reducing waste. I try to find ways to reuse things that would otherwise be thrown away.</p>

		<p>I care for my garden. I've grown pumpkins, and mushrooms. I'm thinking of growing potatoes this year.</p>

		<h3>What I could use help with</h3>

		<p>I need some clean dirt for my garden. If you have some to spare, let me know.</p>

		<p>My project car is a 1970 Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback. The fuel injection system isn't functional because the
			ECM isn't sending a signal to the fuel pump relay when the ignition key is on. I may need a new ECM, or
			maybe the ECM I have can be repaired. </p>
