			<p>Hi, my name's Jesse Hattabaugh, and this is my site. I've been a professional web developer since I graduated High School
				at the turn of the millenium, so I figured I should have a site of my own. I don't really do anything that impressive,
				but whatever. I like to build bicycles, play video games, and drink coffee. I'm a decent writer and alright photographer.
				We'll see if I can come up with something interesting.</p>
