			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>I grew up on a farm. Like a cows and chickens farm. We mostly raised cats and dogs though. I mention that because it feels significant to me, but people find it hard to relate to idyllic upbringings. Rather it seems they want to hear how you suffered. I was lonely; how's that?</p>
			<p>To pass the time I played Sonic the Hedgehog and rode my bicycle up and down the dirt road. Decades later and the graphics got better, and the roads became paved. Other than that not much has changed.</p>
			<p>At the age of 18 with blue hair I walked into an advertising agency in Ft Smith Arkansas, and asked if they needed help building web pages. To my surprise they called me back. Decades later and my hair is back to my natural color, and the web sites are more complicated. Other than that not much has changed.</p>
			<p>I live in Portland Oregon now. I like it here. I don't feel like anyone expects me to be anything. In San Francisco there was a pressure to be interesting. An expectation to perform. But I don't perform. Here, I'm just some dude and people still smile at me.</p>
